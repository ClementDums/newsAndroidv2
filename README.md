# Android News (Second version)

A mobile application for Android which retrieves news from an API and then displays it like a RSS flux. In a beautiful way.
You can like(please note it's not online so only you can see your own like) and see what you liked aaaand that's it I guess. Nothing much here.

## How to download

Simple, you basically need to do a git clone of this and then open it on your android studio.

Change the Apikey variable in in Constants/Constants with your own apikey from https://newsapi.org 
Next, just use your emulator or your phone if you want to test the mobile app.
Right now, the comments are not properly implemented in the application so please don't be too harsh on us. :(
